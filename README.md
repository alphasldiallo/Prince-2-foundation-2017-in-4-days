# Preparation guide for the Prince 2 foundation's exam:

I have 4 days to prepare the exam of Prince 2 foundation. Starting from scratch, I will share with you my journey.

## Day 1: Knowing the principles

### What is Prince 2?

PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) is a structured project management method and practitioner certification programme. PRINCE2 emphasises dividing projects into manageable and controllable stages. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRINCE2)

The six aspects of Prince 2 are the following:
- Scope
- Time scale
- Risk
- Cost
- Quality
- Benefits

The seven principles of Prince 2 are the following:
- Continued Business justification
- Learn by experience
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Manage by stage
- Manage by exception
- Focus on products
- Tailored on project environment

The seven Themes: 
- Business Case
- Organisation
- Quality
- Plans
- Risk
- Change
- Progress

The seven processes:
- Starting up the project
- Initiating (defining the Project Initiation Document)
- Directing the project: How the project management team oversees the project
- Controlling a stage: Dictates how each individual stage should be controlled, including the way in which work packages are authorised and distributed
- Managing Product delivery
- Managing Stage boundaries: How to transition from one stage to another
- Closing up the project

One aim of Prince 2 is to make the right information available at the right time for the right people to make the right decisions about the project. Those decisions include whether to take corrective action or iplement measures to improve performance.
