# Day 1: Knowing the principles

### What is Prince 2?

PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) is a structured project management method and practitioner certification programme. PRINCE2 emphasises dividing projects into manageable and controllable stages. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRINCE2). Industry standard method for managing projects, updated in 2002, 2005, 2009, 2017.

The six aspects of Prince 2 are the following:
- Scope
- Time scale
- Risk
- Cost
- Quality
- Benefits

Te four integrated elements of the Prince 2 structure are:
- The principles
- The Themes
- The processes
- And the project environment.

### The seven principles:
These principles needs to be used in all Prince 2 projects, these are the pillar of each Prince 2 project. There are Universal, Self-validating and Empowering.
The seven principles of Prince 2 are the following:
- Continued Business justification
- Learn by experience
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Manage by stage
- Manage by exception
- Focus on products
- Tailored on project environment

### The seven Themes: 
- Business Case
- Organisation
- Quality
- Plans
- Risk
- Change
- Progress

Business case and risk support the principle of continued business justification.

The organization theme supoort the principle for roles and responsibilities to be clearly defined by establishing an organization structure.

The quality theme establish common understanding of scope and quality criteria. It ensures products are fit for purpose, meet business expectations and enable benefits to be achieved

The plan theme supports several principles including managing by stages, focus on products and manage by exception. It answers the questions: What's required, where and how. When and by Whom.

The progress theme supports the following principles: Manage by stages, continued business justification, learn from experience and manage by exception.

By managing changes to progress in a controlled ways, the change theme supports the principle manage by exception and focus on products.


## The seven processes:
It addresses the chronological flow of the project. Each process includes activity that drives the project forward.

- Starting up the project
- Initiating (defining the Project Initiation Document)
- Directing the project: How the project management team oversees the project
- Controlling a stage: Dictates how each individual stage should be controlled, including the way in which work packages are authorised and distributed
- Managing Product delivery
- Managing Stage boundaries: How to transition from one stage to another
- Closing up the project

One aim of Prince 2 is to make the right information available at the right time for the right people to make the right decisions about the project. Those decisions include whether to take corrective action or iplement measures to improve performance.

## Why Prince 2?
- Proven best practice and governance
- Project viability/business case focus
- Can be applied to any type of project
- Provides a common language for participans
- Product focus and their quality requirements
- Explicit recognition of project responsibilities
- Improved communication and control through plan levels

## Some reasons why projects fail:
- Lack of good business reasons for undertaking the work
- Repeated mistakes
- Failure to involve the customers throughout the project
- Lack of good business reasons for undertaking the work
- Lack of quality requirements and measurable acceptance criteria
- Poorly specified & understood project objectives
- Products not defined in sufficient detail before starting work
- No proper system for capturing & managing changes
- Unclear roles, responsibilities and leadership

## Addressing project failure
- what to be achieved & where
- Why (The business benefits of the undertaking, the major risks facing the project)
- HOW will the work be done
- WHO needs to be involved, to do what
- WHEN do people need to be involved
- HOW LONG will the work take
- HOW MUCH will it cost
- WHAT additional resources are needed, external factors impact on the work and the desired outcome(s)

##Â What is a programme?
Project focus on product or output or delivery capabilities for achieving benefits. Program management is focused on managing those benefits to ensure maximum gains is achieved for the organization. 
Program management provides a framework to co-ordinate, direct and oversee the implementation of a set of related projects and activities in order to deliver outcomes and benefits related to the organization0s strategic objectives.
A programme is likely to have a life that spans several years.

## What is a portfolio?
A portfolio is the totality of an organization's investment (or segment thereof) in the changes required to achieve its strategic objectives.
Portfolio may comprise:
- Projects
- Programmes
- Other work (possibly not interdependent or directly related) but must contribute to the strategic objectives.
